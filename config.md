# Editor Aliases

Set up `shortcut` value to any shortcut which you would like to use for aliases substitution.

`aliases` value should be a dictionary with the following format: `{"alias": "Value to substitute", ...}`. This will result in substituting `alias` for `Value to substitute` each time you use the specified `shortcut`.

To apply configuration changes, **reopen** note adding dialog if it was already open.
